When it comes to a contact form for your website, and you shouldn't have to settle. AJAX, Invisible reCapcha, and no-JS support ... and it only takes a minute to setup.

== Description ==

= Hi Everyone! =

Having a contact form on your website is a pretty basic feature these days. People want to be able to contact you, without having to copy your email address and go to a different app. Problem is, most contact form plugins either require a half hour of complex and code-filled setup, or they don't really work that well. A professional grade contact form needs to come with all the features, without settling. With this plugin, you get:

* Support for: AJAX form submissions (how is this not standard with all contact forms yet?)
* Support for: Google's Invisible reCaptcha (the new 2017 reCaptcha that doesn't require a checkbox)
* Support for: Users who have Javascript disabled.
* Easy Setup: This plugin only takes minute to setup. You simply put in your email address, and place the provided shortcode on any page.
* Customization Options: Entirely optional, you can tweak and customize the contact form.

= --Instructions-- =

* After you install the plugin, go to it's Settings page (either from Settings link the Plugin list, or under the WP admin area's main Settings->Contact Form page).
* Follow instructions provided (which boils down to providing an email address and adding the shortcode)

= Want to Help? =

I'd love some help with internationalization, because I still don't really understand how to do that.

== Installation ==

There are two ways to install this plugin.

Manual:

1. Upload the `featured-galleries` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Go to the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, find 'Professional Contact Form' in the list, and select 'Activate'.

Through the WP Repository:

1. Go to the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, click on the 'Add New' button.
2. Search for 'Professional Contact Form'. Click 'Install Now'.
3. Return to the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, find 'Professional Contact Form' in the list, and select 'Activate'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why another contact form? =

It's not like WordPress doesn't have enough already. I get that. But I recently was working on a new website for a large manufacturing company and I couldn't find a single plugin which met all of the requirements. AJAX, Invisible reCaptcha, no-JS support, no manditory code editing, etc.

= Will it be improved? =

Yes. I plan on redoing the Customization pages to be more graphical. Additionally, I plan on adding filters to allow people to rework any of the fields if they know PHP. Additionally, I want to add Internationalization, and maybe support for multiple contact forms on a single website.
