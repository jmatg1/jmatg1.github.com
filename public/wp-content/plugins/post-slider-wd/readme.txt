[Support Forum](http://web-dorado.com/forum/post-slider-plugin.html)  

Post Slider helps to display posts of your website as a slider. The plugin allows to create sliders from native WordPress posts and custom posts created by third-party plugins.
The plugin has two types of posts sliders: dynamic and static post sliders.    

Using dynamic post slider you can display dynamically changing list of posts, e.g. featured posts, news posts, product post from ecommerce plugins and etc. As initial step you should provide filters which will allow Post Slider plugin to display posts relevant to filtered settings.  

Choose specific posts and display them using static slider. In this case slides will remain unchanged unless you add/edit existing slide list. This is also relevant to custom posts like ecommerce products or events.
Post Slider is fully responsive and looks wonderful with devices of any resolution.  

Using Text layer you can display any text over the slides. In addition you can choose placeholders containing information specific for that post only, e.g. Title, post content, author and etc. Placeholder content will be modified when changes are made to posts. This applies both to static post sliders and dynamic posts sliders.   

Image layers (Paid) will help to add brand logo over post slides.   
If you want to add text over the slide but also want to save space you should use hotspot layer (Paid). It will display hotspot icon over the slide and display text when hovered over this icon.   

Looking for advanced views? Activate Carousel or Parallax views . Carousel view (Paid) displays images with a centered main large image surrounded by smaller images: upon clicking navigation buttons centered image will be shifted. Parallax view  (Pro) displays images with moving layers (with mouse hover).    


Upgrade to [Paid version](https://web-dorado.com/products/wordpress-post-slider-plugin.html) to get access to following features:

*   Slider Image Layer    
*   Slider Hotspot Layer    
*   Social Sharing button layer
